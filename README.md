# Holiday_LEDs_2.0

## Currently not working with ESP8266 Core 2.5.2, working on it.  For now please use 2.4.2.

This repository is to accompany my Holiday LED 2.0 youtube video:

this new version is easier to setup and can support 6 zones dynamically

The node-red portion of the configuration is no longer needed, all processing is handled in the arduino code. 

## Setup Instructions
Fill out the entire USER CONFIGURATION section of the code.

It is recommended that you leave at least 2 zones enabled, leaving only a single zone seems to result in jittery animations. 

## Troubleshooting

-If you get a linker error while compiling in arduino, update your ESP8266 boards manager

-Fire animations are not currently working, I made a couple errors when making them modular, I will fix when I get a couple hours to devote to it.


## Home Assistant YAML

```yaml
##This version of the holiday lights code does not require the node red portion
##The "W" slider under the main "holiday LED" light modifies each effect
##The "W" slider under "Glitter" light modifies the frequency of glitter, the RGB selection changes the color of the glitter
##The "W" slider under "Lightning" switch modifies the frequency of lightning.
##You must replace the [MQTT_CLIENT_ID] with the USER_MQTT_CLIENT_NAME you specified in the arduino USER CONFIGURATION section
